    </header>

    <p>Hi! After living in Köln for almost ten years, I recently moved further up the Rhine to Düsseldorf. I&rsquo;m working as a Cloud Engineer, being responsible for creating reusable Cloud Components and solving &amp; proactively preventing problems in the context of our online retailing platform. Before that, I was working as a <a href="https://www.soerenschneider.com/cv/#cloud-operations-manager-2015-2018">operations guy</a> and <a href="https://www.soerenschneider.com/cv/#software-architect-2015-2018">software architect</a>. Kind of <em>jack of all trades</em>-person despite working in a specialist fields.</p>
<p>I also like to invest a good portion of my spare time on techy stuff: coding, reading technical books, running (semi-)professional home labs, trying to keep up with new technologies or paradigms – or short: practicing continuous improvement. Also, I&rsquo;m a Linux and open source advocate. After figuring out I&rsquo;ve been using Linux <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Archive:SuSE_Linux_7.0">for two decades</a>, I realized I&rsquo;m kind of old.</p>
<p>Topics unrelated to tech that I care about:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.last.fm/user/bob_terwilliger">Music</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gallery.soerenschneider.com">Taking photos</a></li>
<li><a href="https://yummy.soerenschneider.com">Cooking</a></li>
<li>Literature</li>
<li>Hiking, see <a href="https://gallery.soerenschneider.com/2017-06-west-highland-way/">West Highland Way</a> or <a href="https://gallery.soerenschneider.com/2014-08-e5/">E5</a></li>
<li>Running, playing football and recently yoga as well</li>
<li>Tea! I&rsquo;m entertaining quite a collection of Chinese and Japanese teas</li>
</ul>
