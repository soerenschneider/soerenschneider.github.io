      <description>Cool stuff at work Google IAP Kubernetes Controller To allow an uncomplicated exposal of Kubernetes services via a secured Google Identity Aware Proxy, we wrote a Kubernetes Controller that solely works on appropriate labels on the K8s service resources. To be 100% sure that the service is not being exposed publicly (in case Google IAP has trouble), an envoy proxy is injected as a sidecar that performs mandatory JWT verification.</description>

      <description>Abstract While still pursuing my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree, I gained my first work experience being a Research Assistant at Fraunhofer IESE and was working there until I graduated with a master&amp;rsquo;s degree, 5 years later. After one and a half years of gaining experience at my first full time job, I had a rather radical switch at a fully remote, Switzerland-based startup. Being the first technical employee at the startup, I had substantial freedom in designing (from a technical perspective) and implementing the whole initial product.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;ve been living in Cologne for the last couple of years. I&amp;rsquo;m working as a Cloud Engineer, being responsible for creating reusable Cloud Components and solving &amp;amp; proactively preventing problems in the context of our online retailing platform. Before that, I was working as a operations guy and software architect. Kind of jack of all trades-person despite working in a specialist fields.
I also like to spend my spare time around techy stuff, such as writing code, reading technical books/articles, running way too much infrastructure, checking out new technologies/tools or short: practicing improvement.</description>
