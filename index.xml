      <description>Projects at work Chaos Engineering Co-founder of the Chaos Engineering guild that serves as force for the adoption of Chaos Engineering principles at our employer, Rewe Digital. We evaluate tools in the context of Chaos Engineering, provide introduction lessons &amp;amp; workshops, do consultation work and moderate our teams&#39; Gamedays. After hosting several Gamedays for other teams, we also started offering Firedrills, based on common scenarios across our tech-stack (how much is your backup scenario worth if you don&amp;rsquo;t know if it works?</description>

      <description>Abstract With 10+ years of experience working in the industry, I did a full circle iteration: After starting out in software development &amp;amp; architecture, I was responsible (and accountable) for operating distributed systems at scale and recently focussed more on topics around resilience, managing risks and software quality in general. As I&amp;rsquo;ve come across some different technologies, I would describe my main strength as knowing a little bit about a lot of different topics.</description>

      <description>Hi! After living in Köln for almost ten years, I recently moved further up the Rhine to Düsseldorf. I&amp;rsquo;m working as a Cloud Engineer, being responsible for creating reusable Cloud Components and solving &amp;amp; proactively preventing problems in the context of our online retailing platform. Before that, I was working as a operations guy and software architect. Kind of jack of all trades-person despite working in a specialist fields.
I also like to invest a good portion of my spare time on techy stuff: coding, reading technical books, running (semi-)professional home labs, trying to keep up with new technologies or paradigms – or short: practicing continuous improvement.</description>
