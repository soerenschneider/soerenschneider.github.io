    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>While still pursuing my bachelor&rsquo;s degree, I gained my first work experience being a Research Assistant at <a href="https://www.iese.fraunhofer.de/">Fraunhofer IESE</a> and was working there until I graduated with a master&rsquo;s degree, 5 years later. After one and a half years of gaining experience at my first full time job, I had a rather radical switch at a fully remote, Switzerland-based startup. Being the first technical employee at the startup, I had substantial freedom in designing (from a technical perspective) and implementing the whole initial product. When the product gained more and more success, I was able to join my passions and figure out what it means to operate a SaaS product in a professional manor. After 4 years I decided to pick up a new challenge, working as a Cloud Engineer.</p>
<h2 id="cloud-engineer--rd-colognehttpswwwrewe-digitalcom-1118----now"><a href="https://www.rewe-digital.com/">CLOUD ENGINEER @ RD (Cologne)</a>, 11/18 &ndash; now</h2>
<p>In November 2018, I started working at a rather large company whose vision is innovating and leading the food retail digitization in Germany. I ended up in an agile 2-pizza platform/foundation team which is responsible for both operating a large fulfillment platform and providing cloud-native building blocks.</p>
<p>These building blocks</p>
<ul>
<li>offer ready-to-use additions to the GKE/GCE platform that help solve common cloud problems such as monitoring, networking, transparency, secrets management, cost control, backups, etc.</li>
<li>are either self-written software, pre-configured sets of 3rd party software or both.</li>
<li>are used as a multiplicator for other internal teams</li>
</ul>
<p>We typically try to follow the SRE approach of using max 50% of the time to operate the platform and the other time to get rid of toil and improving the platform by writing dedicated (automation) software.</p>
<h4 id="responsibilities--tasks">RESPONSIBILITIES / TASKS:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Active contribution to the evolution of the platform, especially in regards of (cost) transparency, maintainability, scalability and robustness</li>
<li>Proactively preventing issues and allowing faster MBR by writing automation software</li>
<li>Providing help across team boundaries for devs</li>
<li>Performing Kubernetes on-boarding for new colleagues</li>
<li>Progressing SRE methologies</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="technologies">TECHNOLOGIES:</h4>

<p>As the company grew considerably, the operations part became more and more critical to success. As I was the employee with the most experience in networking and running workloads, I took over the newly created role and was responsible for the cloud operations segment. After already conducting some longer running tests with AWS, my first <em>baptême du feu</em> was planning the future cloud architecture at AWS and performing its migration.</p>
<h4 id="responsibilities--tasks-1">RESPONSIBILITIES / TASKS:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Providing and operating a scalable and robust platform
<ul>
<li>Planned and realized AWS cloud architecture</li>
<li>Performed migration from Swisscom Enterprise Cloud Solution to AWS</li>

<li>Analyzing performance-, security- and network-related issues</li>
<li>Monitoring infrastructure- and service health</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Containerized all workloads</li>

<p>In January 2015 I started working for the Switzerland-based startup whose vision is to improve master data quality related to business partners. As I was the first technical employee, I translated and realized all initial business requirements as a working software solution that proved itself over the years. The resulting SaaS platform allowed corporations to share and thus improve their data. Later, more and more related services, such as bank fraud detection and -prevention, were added to the product.</p>
<p>Due to the startup&rsquo;s success, its mothership company was able to shift its business model from offering classical consulting services to a &lsquo;tool-based consulting&rsquo; approach, using the internally-built and tailored tools closely with (potential) customers. Seeing the company&rsquo;s still flourishing and growing after having had so much responsibility in its early stages makes me feel both gratified and satisfied, for being given the chance and for having succeeded.</p>
<h4 id="responsibilities--tasks-2">RESPONSIBILITIES / TASKS:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Creating a MVP of the data sharing SaaS product
<ul>
<li>Defining SaaS components</li>
<li>Providing Swisscom Enterprise Cloud Infrastructure</li>

<p>Being mainly driven by the idealistic motive of getting paid working on Open Source software, I got my first full-time job working as a software developer on OpenCMS. My main tasks included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working on OpenCMS</li>
