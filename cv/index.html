    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>While still pursuing my bachelor&rsquo;s degree, I gained my first work experience being a Research Assistant at <a href="https://www.iese.fraunhofer.de/">Fraunhofer IESE</a> and was working there until I graduated with a master&rsquo;s degree, 5 years later. After one and a half years of gaining experience at my first full time job, I had a rather radical switch at a fully remote, Switzerland-based startup. Being the first technical employee at the startup, I had substantial freedom in designing (from a technical perspective) and implementing the whole initial product. When the product gained more and more success, I was able to join my passions and figure out what it means to operate a SaaS product in a professional manor. After 4 years I decided to pick up a new challenge, working as a Cloud Engineer.</p>
<h2 id="cloud-engineer--rdhttpswwwrewe-digitalcom-2018--now"><a href="https://www.rewe-digital.com/">CLOUD ENGINEER @ RD</a>, 2018 – now</h2>
<p>In November 2018, I started working at a rather large company whose vision is innovating and leading the food retail digitization in Germany. I ended up in a 2-pizza platform/foundation team which is responsible for both operating a large fulfillment platform and providing cloud-native building blocks.</p>
<p>These building blocks</p>
<ul>
<li>offer ready-to-use additions to the GKE/GCE platform that help solve common cloud problems such as monitoring, networking, transparency, secrets management, cost control, backups, etc.</li>
<li>are either self-written software, pre-configured sets of 3rd party software or both.</li>
<li>are used as a multiplicator for other internal teams</li>
</ul>
<p>We typically try to follow the SRE approach of using max 50% of the time to operate the platform and the other time to automate toil away.</p>
<h4 id="responsibilities--tasks">RESPONSIBILITIES / TASKS:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Active contribution to the evolution of the platform, especially in regards of (cost) transparency, maintainability, scalability and robustness</li>
<li>Operating a platform using Google Cloud</li>
<li>Proactively preventing issues and allowing faster MBR by writing automation software</li>
<li>Providing help across team boundaries for devs</li>
<li>Performing Kubernetes on-boarding for new colleagues</li>
<li>Progressing SRE methologies</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="technologies">TECHNOLOGIES:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Google Cloud: GKE, GCE, IAP, Cloud SQL, Cloud Functions, Datastore, Pub Sub, Kafka, Stackdriver</li>
<li>Golang, Python, Shell</li>
<li>Hashicorp Vault, Terraform</li>
<li>Prometheus, Grafana, Cortex</li>
<li>Jenkins, GitHub Enterprise</li>
</ul>

<p>As the company grew considerably in 2016, so did the number of different hats to wear - new roles with different responsibilities were defined. My responsibilities transitioned to being almost platform-exclusive. I was still integral member of the software architectural board, pushing topics related to cloud-computing problems. The first <em>baptême du feu</em> was planning the future cloud architecture at AWS and performing its migration.</p>
<h4 id="responsibilities--tasks-1">RESPONSIBILITIES / TASKS:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Providing and operating a scalable and robust platform
<ul>
<li>Planned and realized AWS cloud architecture</li>
<li>Performed migration from Swisscom Enterprise Cloud Solution to AWS</li>
<li>Providing development tools (CI/CD, Artifact storage, config server)</li>
<li>Providing dynamic staging  and testing environments</li>
<li>Analyzing performance-, security- and network-related issues</li>
<li>Monitoring infrastructure- and service health</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Positioning cloud contextual topics at architectural board
<ul>
<li>Eliminating state, container lifetimes, consensus, cgroup limits, &hellip;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Guidance for team members
<ul>
<li>Kubernetes basics</li>
<li>Building Docker images correctly</li>
<li>How to define Prometheus metrics &amp; alerts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Infrastructure documentation and compliance</li>
<li>Realization, verification and instrumentation of backups</li>
<li>Cost management</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="technologies-1">TECHNOLOGIES:</h4>

<h2 id="software-architect--cdqhttpswwwcdqchdata-sharingdata-sharing-community-2015--2018"><a href="https://www.cdq.ch/data-sharing/data-sharing-community">SOFTWARE ARCHITECT @ CDQ</a> 2015&ndash;2018</h2>
<p>In January 2015 I started working for the Switzerland-based startup whose vision is to improve master data quality related to business partners. Working as a software architect and being the only employee besides my supervisor gave me a great deal of freedom in the realization of the product. As a result, a successful SaaS platform that allows corporations to anonymously share and thus improve their data was created. Later, more and more related services, such as bank fraud detection and -prevention, were added to the product. Seeing the company&rsquo;s still flourishing after having had so much responsibility in its early stages makes me feel both gratified and satisfied, for being given the chance and for having succeeded.</p>
<h4 id="responsibilities--tasks-2">RESPONSIBILITIES / TASKS:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Creating a MVP of the data sharing SaaS products
<ul>
<li>Defining SaaS components</li>
<li>Providing Swisscom Enterprise Cloud Infrastructure</li>
<li>Implementation work using tracer approach</li>
<li>(Initial) API Design</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Documentation of software architecture and architectural choices</li>
<li>Data model designs</li>
<li>Providing local software testing stack via Docker</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="technologies-2">TECHNOLOGIES:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Java, Gradle</li>
<li>Spring (-boot, -data, -security, -cloud, -batch), Hibernate/JPA, JMS</li>
<li>MySQL, Redis, Apache Solr, ElasticSearch, OpenLDAP, simpleSAML, (Bamboo), Jenkins, OpenVPN, MongoDB</li>
</ul>

<p>Being mainly driven by the idealistic motive of getting paid working on Open Source software, I got my first full-time job working as a software developer on OpenCMS. My main tasks included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working on OpenCMS</li>
<li>Various works around the Solr-powered full text search module</li>
<li>Creation of a full text search web framework using handlebars, GWT and SOLR</li>
